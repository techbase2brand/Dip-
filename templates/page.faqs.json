The primary reason for skin irritation is the alkaline ph level which is often up to 10 in regular Laundry Detergents (Bleach is 12+). <strong>Our strips have a neutral ph (7) which is the equivalent of water, they are hypoallergenic and great for sensitive skin.<\/strong><\/p>\n      <p><strong>Why we use enzymes: <\/strong>Enzymes  are naturally occurring proteins that help breakdown tough stains, especially in cold water.
